## Structure of the repository

`architecture` contains the database model created with MySQL workbench
together with images

`procedures` contains stored procedures. Probably `AddValidBooking` was referred
to as `ManagedBooking` in the last module. I left the name as it was before.

`queries` are business-logic queries which were required, but
were not required to be stored as a separate procedures.

`prepared_statements` is one prepared statement

`tableau` contains the Tableau workbook. I do not provide `.xlsx` file due to
probable copyright. By the same reason I do not provide the full data used to
populate the tables during testing - it was derived from the proprietry course
materials.

`views` contains one view which was required.

`jupyter` has the jupyter notebook used to connect and query the database
back-end.

`LittleLemonDB.sql` contains the database initialization routines generated by
MySQL Workbench.

## Note on database organization

Subtle difference witth the default way is the `MenusOrders` table. It is used
to extend the flexibility of the schema and allow one to have multiple menus
accounted for the same order (many-to-many). It resulted in slightly more
complex related queries which needed one extra `JOIN`.

## On the commit history

This repo contains the subset of commits with the results. I had to
re-initialize it to exclude potentially copyrighted materials from the commit
history.
